# Philosopher King RNN
A RNN that generates text after training on English philosophy data.

Original code is from [Andrej Karpathy's char-rnn gist](https://gist.github.com/karpathy/d4dee566867f8291f086).

Adapted to include save/resume abilities and to use my own collected philosophy dataset that contains ~1 million characters from works by Nietzsche, Plato, Locke, and others.

--- UPDATE ---
I redid this project with Keras and only using Plato's Republic. See the new files.
